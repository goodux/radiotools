Easily add a streaming audio player to your site with a shortcode. Easy to customise!

== Description ==
Radio Tools lets you add a streaming audio player, powered by Howler.js, to your site via a shortcode. You can easily customise the player template to unlock the true potential of Howler.js. This is easy for beginners and experts.

Stream supports AAC or mp3.
Proxy currently only supports AAC and may not be supported on most servers.

### Want to customise your own player?

1. Go to the plugins directory, and copy the template file from ```<plugin_directory>/templates/player.php```
2. Copy player.php into your theme directory, ```<theme_directory>/radio-tools/player.php```
